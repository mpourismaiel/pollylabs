Compilers use static analyses to justify program optimizations.As every optimization must preserve the semantics of the original program,static analysis typically fall-back to conservative approximations.Consequently, the set of states for which the optimization is invalid isoverapproximated and potential optimization opportunities are missed. Insteadof justifying the optimization statically, a compiler can also synthesizepreconditions that imply the correctness of the optimizations and are checkedat the runtime of the program.  In this paper, we present a framework tocollect, generalize, and simplify assumptions based on Presburger arithmetic.We introduce different assumptions necessary to enable a variety of complexloop transformations and derive a (close to) minimal set of preconditions tovalidate them at runtime. Our evaluation shows that the runtime verificationintroduces negligible overhead and that the assumptions we propose almostalways hold true. On a large benchmark set including SPEC and NPB our techniqueincreases the number of modeled non-trivial loop nests by a factor of 3.9Ã—.}
