We are happy to announce that Google selected [Polly Labs]({{site.baseurl}}) as
one of the mentoring organizations for
[Summer of Code 2018](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/).
Our page at Google as participating organization is
[here](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/4743716460298240/).
Like 2017 we will assist students to enter open source development for
polyhedral optimization and compilation.

If you are currently enrolled at a university or college and you are interested
in contributing in the field of polyhedral compilation, we invite you to apply
with a project proposal at Google. The first step is to contact us on one of our
projects' mailing list. See the
[2018 ideas and information page]({{site.baseurl}}/gsoc2018.html) for
more detailed instructions and ideas for projects. Hints for writing a good
proposal are found on our
[How-to-apply page]({{site.baseurl}}/gsoc-how-to-apply.html).
