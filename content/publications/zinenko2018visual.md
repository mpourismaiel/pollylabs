Parallelism is one of the key performance sources in moderncomputer systems. When heuristics-based automatic parallelization fails toimprove performance, a cumbersome and error-prone manual transformation isoften required. As a solution, we propose an interactive visual approachbuilding on the polyhedral model that visualizes exact dependencies andparallelism; decomposes and replays a complex automatically computedtransformation step by step; and allows for directly manipulating the visualrepresentation as a means of transforming the program with immediate feedback.User studies suggest that our visualization is understood by experts andnonexperts alike, and that it may favor an exploratory approach.},
