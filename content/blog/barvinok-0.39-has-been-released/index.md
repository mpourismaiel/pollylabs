---


<a href="http://barvinok.gforge.inria.fr/">barvinok 0.39</a>
was released containing various changes:

 * **Support more recent versions of NTL**

   In particular, assume NTL has been compiled in ISO mode,
   which has been the default ever since NTL 5.4, and
   handle a change in internal representation of NTL.

 * **Support more operations in iscc**

   These additional operations are needed for some of the examples in the
   <a href="https://lirias.kuleuven.be/handle/123456789/523109">
   Presburger Formulas and Polyhedral Compilation</a> tutorial.
